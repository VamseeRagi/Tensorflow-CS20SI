# Tensorflow-CS20SI
CS20SI Tutorials Using Tensorflow

## About CS20SI
[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is a powerful open-source software library for machine learning developed by researchers at Google Brain. It has many pre-built functions to ease the task of building different neural networks. Tensorflow allows distribution of computation across different computers, as well as multiple CPUs and GPUs within a single machine. TensorFlow provides a Python API, as well as a less documented C++ API. This repository uses the Python API. 

This course covers the fundamentals and contemporary usage of the Tensorflow library for deep learning research. The aim is to help students understand the graphical computational model of Tensorflow, explore the functions it has to offer, and learn how to build and structure models best suited for a deep learning project. Through the course, students will use Tensorflow to build models of different complexity, from simple linear/logistic regression to convolutional neural network and recurrent neural networks with LSTM to solve tasks such as word embeddings, translation, optical character recognition. Students will also learn best practices to structure a model and manage research experiments.

Thanks to instructor [Chip Huyen](huyenn@stanford.edu) for this great course.

## Prerequisites

* Proficiency in Python
	All class assignments will be in Python. There is a tutorial here for those who aren't as familiar with Python. If you have a lot of programming experience but in a different language (e.g. C/C++/Matlab/Javascript), you will probably be fine.
* Equivalent knowledge of CS229 (Machine Learning)
	We will not ask you to take derivatives or build your own optimizers, but you should know what they are and how to use them.
* Basic Theoretical Understanding of Neural Networks (e.g. CS 231N)
	This course focuses more on the practical usage of Tensorflow in deep learning projects, therefore you can benefit more from the course if you already have basic understanding of neural networks: feed-forward, convnet, LSTM, sequence to sequence model.

## Disclaimer

Some of the code in this repository might be broken or might not work under certain circumstances. Also, I cannot guarantee the correctness for any of the solutions as and when they are present in the course. I was not able to completely do all the assignments owing to the paucity of resources as only the slides were available and the material was getting complex. Use the code at your own discretion.
